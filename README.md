# English Premier league 2019-20 data 

# Motivation
I decided to make this project based on soccer. So, While browsing the internet for some datsets, I found a few datasets that seemed to have pretty good data for entire seasons of the english Premier league which is the highest division of english soccer.Being pretty intrigued, I went through the data. Naturally, this led to some questions. This led to me comparing between different data columns. The Main question Im trying to answer is what is the relationship between the number of shots taken by the home and away teams and the number of goals scored by the home and away teams.

# Data Sources
I obtained this data from the datahub.io website. I extracted the dataset of the 2018-2019 english Premier League season from the football dataset section of the datahub.io website. The website sourced this data from the website www.football-data.co.uk

# Processing steps 
The datset that I had procured needed to be processed. The main issue with the dataset was that it was faily large. This meant that some columns did not show up on jupyter notebook as the dataset was being compressed. This means that a new dataset from the existing dataset had to be made. The Processing 2018-2019 ibynb file extracts columns from the existing dataset and combines them to create a new dataset that shows all the columns that are required.

The new processed dataset looks like this :
