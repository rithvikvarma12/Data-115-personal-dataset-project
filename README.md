# English Premier league 2019-20 data 

# Motivation
I decided to make this project based on soccer. So, While browsing the internet for some datsets, I found a few datasets that seemed to have pretty good data for entire seasons of the english Premier league which is the highest division of english soccer.Being pretty intrigued, I went through the data. Naturally, this led to some questions. This led to me comparing between different data columns. The Main question Im trying to answer is what is the relationship between the number of shots taken by the home and away teams and the number of goals scored by the home and away teams.

# Data Sources
I obtained this data from the datahub.io website. I extracted the dataset of the 2018-2019 english Premier League season from the football dataset section of the datahub.io website. The website sourced this data from the website www.football-data.co.uk
